# CRYPTO-PLANTS-ON-NFT

CryptoPlants is a crowd-funding platform for environmental and social causes. It will have a DAO of NGOs who get to raise funds by issuing NFTs on our platform.

Users earn CryptoPlants by buying 'seeds' from NGOs. Each seed sponsors a specific cause like food donations or aforestation. Every CryptoPlant is unique digital art which can be traded and sold on platforms like OpenSea. We want to gamify donations and create a collectables community, so NGOs get better returns.
Benefits
For users

    Show off your CryptoPlants and environmental impact to the world
    Collect rare trees and resell. Every plant is unique
    Offset company carbon emissions
    Transparency on fund usage
    Purchase one-time or show continued support by purchasing a subscription

For NGOs

    Become part of the CryptoPlants DAO
    Better conversions compared to traditional advertisements. NGOs spend 10-15% of their budgets on donation-seeking ads. Conversion rate is low since donations are philantropic acts. We will bring better returns by turning donations into cypto-collectables. People splurge thousands on digital kittens

Future scope

    Top donors' leaderboard.
    Become a gifting platform. Many hackathons give away free t-shirts, but many users don't need them (we ourselves have some 15 swag shirts). Shipping shirts across continents is not very environment friendly. Instead let them opt for a free CryptoPlant! HacktoberFest did this, letting users opt for planting a real tree on tree-nation.org
